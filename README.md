Use Case | Description | SAP BTP Services | Blog Post
---------|----------|----------|----------
[`01-Social Media Citizen Reporting`](01-social-media-citizen-reporting) | In this session we will do an in-depth exploration of the new Generative AI Hub and its industry solution. Learn how to quickly develop generative AI for SAP BTP apps securely, with access to a variety of large language models. The Generative AI Hub is the central cockpit in SAP BTP, allowing you to create, operate, monitor, and orchestrate your generative AI scenarios. It provides tools for efficient prompt engineering and prompt management, experimentation through the playground, and access to code libraries and SDKs. | Generative AI Hub, SAP AI Core, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Cloud, CAP, SAP Build Apps | TBA
[`02-Generative AI-based code development with Joule in SAP Build Code`](02-) | In this session we will do an in-depth exploration of ”capGPT” and show how it can help increase development productivity by using generative AI for automatic code generation based on Cloud Platform Application Programming (CAP) model. | SAP Build Code, Joule, CAP | TBA
[`03-Embedding business context with the SAP HANA Cloud, Vector Engine`](03-) | In this session we will do an in-depth exploration of the new Vector Engine in SAP HANA Cloud and show how it can help ground/embed your models to put its responses into the right business context for better and more relevant outcomes and eliminate “hallucinations”. | Generative AI Hub, SAP HANA Cloud, Vector Engine, SAP AI Core | TBA

Please note that the table above reflects the current state of planning, and that actual topics and timelines may change completely. Additional sessions will be added throughout the year.
