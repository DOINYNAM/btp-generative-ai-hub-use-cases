## Citizen Reporting app for Public Administrations

This repository aims to showcase a BTP-based use case empowered by Generative AI Hub so that can inspire you in building similar use cases. 
More details about the use case can be found [here](https://partneredge.sap.com/en/library/education/products/btp/build/e_ep_use-cases_ai-foundation.html?#accordion-panel-section-libraryItem-descriptionSection-accordionitem_694022185).
The use case is around a fictitious city called "Sagenai City" facing challenges in managing and tracking maintenance in public areas. The city wants to improve the way they handle reported issues from the citizens, by analyzing social media posts & making informed decisions and so effectively tracking & managing issues in public spaces.

For this proof-of-concept, we have developed a prototype leveraging SAP Generative AI Hub to analyze social media posts & give relevant insights and prioritize maintenance requests, which in return will offer efficient resolution to incidents, and provide improved visibility on the cityâ€™s infrastructure status.

You can get the source code for the different modules implemented as part of our proof of concept in the folders shared in this repository:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
[`cap-app/`](cap-app) | NodeJS (with TypeScript) CAP orchestrator app including SAP HANA Cloud, Vector Engine, Generative AI Hub integration, SAP S/4HANA Cloud Maintenance Notifications creation and Reddit APIs integration.
[`build-app/`](build-app) | SAP Build Apps package containing the prototyped User Interface
